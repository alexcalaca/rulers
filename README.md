# The Rulers Framework Project
It is a complete `Ruby MVC framework` from an empty directory. This framework is structured like Rails, using the same architecture and the same metaprogramming tricks. By building it, You'll learn the magic behind Rails.

Besides, it allow us to get the gut-level understanding that only a framework builder has.

# The book: "Rebuilding Rails" by Noah Gibbs
`Ruby on Rails` is known for being “magical”. A lot of that magic makes sense after you’ve built with those Ruby features.

Knowing the deepest levels of any piece of software lets you master it. It’s a special kind of  competence you can’t fake. You have to know it so well you could build it. What if you did build t? Wouldn’t that be worth it?

Each chapter is about building a system in a `Rails-like framework`, which we’ll call Rulers (like, Ruby on Rulers). Rulers is much simpler than Rails. But once you build the simple version, you’ll know what the complicated version does and a lot of how it works.

To be an expert, learn the fundamentals. Then you can pick up not just Rails, but `any framework you want`. Rebuilding Rails will show you the tricks and where to start reading the source code.

# Rulers

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/rulers`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add rulers

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install rulers

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
